# helix-hl2rp-withoutnetstream
Helix is a framework for roleplay gamemodes in Garry's Mod, based off of NutScript 1.1. Helix provides a stable, feature-filled, open-source, and DRM-free base so you can focus more on the things you want: making gameplay.

Getting Started
To start working on your gamemode, you'll need to set up a schema for Helix. This is a specially structured gamemode that uses Helix as its base - but instead of creating all the files and bootstrapping properly yourself, you can fork/copy the skeleton schema that has all of this done already at https://github.com/NebulousCloud/helix-skeleton. The skeleton contains all the important elements you need to have a functioning schema so you can get coding right away.

Plugins
If you'd like to enhance your gamemode, you can use any of the freely provided plugins available at the Helix Plugin Center. It is also encouraged to submit your own plugins for others to find and use at https://github.com/nebulouscloud/helix-plugins

Documentation
Up-to-date documentation can be found at https://docs.gethelix.co. This is automatically updated when commits are pushed to the master branch.

If you'd like to ask some questions or integrate with the community, you can always join our Discord server. We highly encourage you to search through the documentation before posting a question - the docs contain a good deal of information about how the various systems in Helix work, and it might explain what you're looking for.


Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull request with any fixes/changes that you might find beneficial. Currently, there are no solid contributing guidelines other than keeping your code consistent with the rest of the framework.

Acknowledgements
Helix is a fork of NutScript 1.1 by Chessnut and rebel1324.
